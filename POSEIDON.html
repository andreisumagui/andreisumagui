<img src="poseidon.jpg" height=400>
<p>Was one of the Twelve Olympians in ancient Greek religion and myth, god of the sea,
 storms, earthquakes and horses.In pre-Olympian Bronze Age Greece, he was venerated as a
 chief deity at Pylos and Thebes.He also had the cult title "earth shaker". In the myths 
of isolated Arcadia he is related with Demeter and Persephone and he was venerated as a horse,
 however, it seems that he was originally a god of the waters. He is often regarded as the tamer
 or father of horses, and with a strike of his trident, he created springs which are related to 
the word horse. His Roman equivalent is Neptune.
