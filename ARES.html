<h1>ARES.</h1>
<h3 align=center>ARES (GOD OF WAR)</h3>
<img src="Picture_4.jpg" height=400>
<p>Árēs is the Greek god of war and courage. He is one of the Twelve Olympians, and the son of Zeus and Hera.
The Greeks were ambivalent towards him. He embodies the physical valor necessary for success in war but
can also personify sheer brutality and bloodlust, in contrast to his sister, the armored Athena, whose martial
functions include military strategy and generalship. An association with Ares endows places, objects,and other
deities with a savage, dangerous, or militarized quality.
<p>Although Ares' name shows his origins as Mycenaean,
 his reputation for savagery was thought by some to reflect his likely origins as a Thracian deity. Some cities
 in Greece and several in Asia Minor held annual festivals to bind and detain him as their protector.
 In parts of Asia Minor, he was an oracular deity. Still further away from Greece, the Scythians were said to
 ritually kill one in a hundred prisoners of war as an offering to their equivalent of Ares. The later belief that
 ancient Spartans had offered human sacrifice to Ares may owe more to mythical prehistory, misunderstandings, and reputation than to reality.
