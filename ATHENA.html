<P>Athena or Athene, often given the epithet Pallas, is an ancient Greek goddess associated with wisdom, 
warfare, and handicraft who was later syncretized with the Roman goddess Minerva. Athena was regarded as
 the patron and protectress of various cities across Greece, particularly the city of Athens, from which she
 most likely received her name. The Parthenon on the Acropolis of Athens is dedicated to her. Her major
 symbols include owls, olive trees, snakes, and the Gorgoneion. In art, she is generally depicted wearing a helmet and holding a spear.
<p>From her origin as an Aegean palace goddess, Athena was closely associated with the city. She was known as
 Polias and Poliouchos (both derived from polis, meaning "city-state"), and her temples were usually 
located atop the fortified acropolis in the central part of the city. The Parthenon on the Athenian Acropolis
 is dedicated to her, along with numerous other temples and monuments. As the patron of craft and weaving, Athena
 was known as Ergane. She was also a warrior goddess, and was believed to lead soldiers into battle as Athena Promachos.
 Her main festival in Athens was the Panathenaia, which was celebrated during the month of Hekatombaion in midsummer and was the most important festival on the Athenian calendar.
