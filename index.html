<p>Zeus is the sky and thunder god in ancient Greek religion, who rules as king
of the gods of Mount Olympus. His name is cognate with the first element of 
his Roman equivalent Jupiter. His mythology and powers are similar, though 
not identical, to those of Indo-European deities such as Jupiter, PerkÅ«nas, 
Perun, Indra, Dyaus and Thor.
<p>Zeus is the child of Cronus and Rhea, the youngest of his siblings 
to be born, though sometimes reckoned the eldest as the others required disgorging
 from Cronus's stomach. In most traditions, he is married to Hera, by whom he is usually
 said to have fathered Ares, Eileithyia, Hebe, and Hephaestus.At the oracle of Dodona, his
 consort was said to be Dione, by whom the Iliad states that he fathered Aphrodite. According 
to the Theogony, Zeus' first wife was Metis, by whom he had Athena. Zeus was also infamous for his
 erotic escapades. These resulted in many divine and heroic offspring, including Apollo, Artemis, Hermes,
 Persephone, Dionysus, Perseus, Heracles, Helen of Troy, Minos, and the Muses.
