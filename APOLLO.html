<P>Apollo is one of the Olympian deities in classical Greek and Roman religion and Greek and Roman mythology.
 The national divinity of the Greeks, Apollo has been recognized as a god of archery, music and dance, truth 
and prophecy, healing and diseases, the Sun and light, poetry, and more. One of the most important and complex 
of the Greek gods, he is the son of Zeus and Leto, and the twin brother of Artemis, goddess of the hunt.
 Seen as the most beautiful god and the ideal of the kouros (ephebe, or a beardless, athletic youth), Apollo 
is considered to be the most Greek of all the gods.[citation needed] Apollo is known in Greek-influenced Etruscan mythology as Apulu.
<P>As the patron deity of Delphi (Apollo Pythios), Apollo is an oracular godâ€”the prophetic deity of the Delphic Oracle.
 Apollo is the god who affords help and wards off evil; various epithets call him the "averter of evil".
