<P>Hera is the goddess of marriage, women and family, and the protector of women during childbirth.
 In Greek mythology, she is queen of the twelve Olympians and Mount Olympus, sister and wife of Zeus,
 and daughter of the Titans Cronus and Rhea. One of her defining characteristics in myth is her jealous and vengeful
 nature in dealing with any who offend her, especially Zeus' numerous adulterous lovers and illegitimate offspring.
Her iconography usually presents her as a dignified, matronly figure, upright or enthroned, crowned with a polos or diadem,
 sometimes veiled as a married woman. She is the patron goddess of lawful marriage. 
<p>She presides over weddings, blesses and 
legalises marital unions, and protects women from harm during childbirth. Her sacred animals include the cow, cuckoo and the peacock.
 She is sometimes shown holding a pomegranate, as an emblem of immortality. Her Roman counterpart is Juno.
